# John Pellman's Curated and Organized Github Stars

This repo contains a raw dump of my data as used by the [Astral](https://github.com/astralapp/astral) app for the curation of Github stars.  A self-hosted version of Astral can be assembled using the instructions on the Astral Github page.  The primary Astral instance is located at https://astralapp.com.
