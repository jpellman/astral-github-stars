# John Pellman's Curated and Organized Github Stars

This repo hosts a static site that displays exported data from the [Astral](https://github.com/astralapp/astral) app, which is used for the curation / tagging of Github stars.  I add raw data that has been exported from Astral manually (`jpellman_astral_data.json`), a build script processes this data and converts it into a set of Markdown documents, and then [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) generates the static site.
